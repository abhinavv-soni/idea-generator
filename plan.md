<Clarification Required>
1. Should the OpenAI API key be stored per session or persisted?
2. What specific project metrics should be tracked for consistency?
3. What format/template should the PDF export follow?
4. Should the app support offline mode with cached AI responses?
5. Are there any specific industries/niches to focus on for idea generation?
